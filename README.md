## Introduction

Since 2001, I have been working in front of the same screen — but the light changes every six months. Technology evolves rapidly, and so do I. Staying current and adapting has always been my mission, and now I am excited to share that knowledge with you through expert teaching and training.

# The Pentesting Lesson

I saw a pentester relying on a tool and reporting that a server in a /25 subnet was offline. In reality, the server was live and reachable on the network — the tool just couldn’t see it. My heart nearly boiled — it felt like I’d taken the wrong medicine!

I calmly said:  
**“You’re not on the same subnet as the server. The server isn’t offline — you’re simply on a different network.”**  
**Lesson:** Being inside a tool ≠ being on the network.  
Dude, you’re inside the tool — but not inside the network! 🤦‍♂️😂  
Sometimes tools lie, but the network doesn’t! 😅🔌  
**Know your routing. Know your scope. Tools don’t replace understanding.**

## Who I Am

Where am I after 25 years?

I am a **Network | Cloud & Cybersecurity | Consultant | Technologist** with a passion for building resilient, secure systems and teaching what I learn.

---

## Skills & Mindset

- Cybersecurity Fundamentals, Monitoring & Tooling (e.g., SolarWinds)  
- Defensive Security & Cloud-First Security Architectures  
- Access and Identity Management (IAM) – RBAC, SSO, MFA (hybrid & cloud)  
- Zero Trust Architecture, SASE, Network Access Control  
- Next-Gen Firewalls (NGFWs), identity-based access control  
- Routing & Switching: OSPF, BGP, MPLS  

> **Knowing the Network is Knowing What We Need to Secure.**  
> We can’t protect what we don’t understand.  
> “Don’t ask what an asset is — ask how to protect it.  
> Don’t ask what a risk is — ask how to prevent it.  
> Don’t ask what a threat is — ask how to stop it.  
> Memorising names doesn’t protect infrastructures — taking action does.”

## 🔐 Security on Paper - Domain 1 (CISSP)

## ✅ Asset

Anything valuable to the business that must be protected.  
Examples: Servers, laptops, databases, IPs, brand trust, public perception, employees, Business secret and compliance status.

## ⚠️ Threat

Anything that can cause damage to an asset.  
Examples: Hackers, malware, ransomware, nation-state actors, zero-days, fires, floods.

> Threats exploit vulnerabilities in OS and code.

## 🧩 Vulnerability

A weakness that allows a threat to succeed.

Examples:
- Unpatched systems, weak passwords, no MFA  
- Heavy-theory environments (docs but no protection)  
- Security theatre (compliance over real security)  
- Politics over protection  
- Delay to patch/modernise  
- Lack of leadership support  

## 💰 Risk

The potential loss (financial or otherwise) if a threat exploits a vulnerability and impacts an asset.

## 💰 Risk Formula

**Risk = Threat × Vulnerability × Impact**  
High Risk = Real Threat + Weak Defenses + Valuable Asset  
Lowering any one factor reduces risk.

---

what about BBC.

 tshark -i 6 -Y "dns.qry.name contains bbc.co.uk"
Capturing on 'WiFi'
 1670  49.724700 172.20.10.41 → 208.67.222.222 DNS 69 Standard query 0xe04f A bbc.co.uk

The DNS server replies with a DNS response:
We see  several IP addresses for bbc.co.uk (there are multiple IPs for load balancing right as shown below

- 151.101.128.81
- 151.101.192.81

We applied the same method used for the BBC to Google and captured the results using:
tshark -i 6 -Y "dns.qry.name contains google.com"

Tips: 

The TCP connection was successfully established (you saw the 3-way handshake complete).
But no actual data was transferred yet, as indicated by **Len=0** in all packets shown.
