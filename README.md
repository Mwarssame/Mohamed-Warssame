## Introduction

Since 2005, I have been working in front of the same screen — but the light changes every six months. Technology evolves rapidly, and so do I. Staying current and adapting has always been my mission.
**My professional journey** began at **Computer Exchange (CEX)** and evolved through roles in **large retail chains**, **transport and logistics**, **healthcare**, **internet and email service providers (ISPs/ESPs)**, and **City Council**. I later joined **managed service providers (MSPs)**, contributed to **social media platforms**, and most recently transitioned into the **public sector**. Each domain brought its own challenges and shaped my approach to building secure, and resilient systems.

# The Pentesting Lesson

I saw a pentester relying on a tool and reporting that a server in a /25 subnet was offline. In reality, the server was live and reachable on the network — the tool just couldn’t see it. My heart nearly boiled — it felt like I’d taken the wrong medicine!

I calmly said:  
**“You’re not on the same subnet as the server. The server isn’t offline — you’re simply on a different network.”**  
**Lesson:** Being inside a tool ≠ being on the network.  
Dude, you’re inside the tool — but not inside the network! 🤦‍♂️😂  
Sometimes tools lie, but the network doesn’t! 😅🔌  
**Know your routing. Know your scope. Tools don’t replace understanding.**

## Who I Am

Where am I after 20 years?

I am a **Network | Cloud & Cybersecurity | Consultant | Technologist** with a passion for building resilient, secure systems and teaching what I learn.

---

## Skills & Mindset.

- Cybersecurity Fundamentals, Monitoring & Tooling (e.g., SolarWinds)  
- Defensive Security & Cloud-First Security Architectures  
- Access and Identity Management (IAM) – RBAC, SSO, MFA (hybrid & cloud)  
- Zero Trust Architecture, SASE, Network Access Control  
- Next-Gen Firewalls (NGFWs), identity-based access control  
- Routing & Switching: OSPF, BGP, and MPLS  

> **Knowing the Network is Knowing What We Need to Secure.**  
> We can’t protect what we don’t understand.  
> “Don’t ask what an asset is — ask how to protect it.  
> Don’t ask what a risk is — ask how to prevent it.  
> Don’t ask what a threat is — ask how to stop it.  
> Memorising names doesn’t protect infrastructures — taking action does.”

## 🔐 Security on Paper - Domain 1 (CISSP)

##  Asset

Anything valuable to the business that must be protected.  
Examples: Servers, laptops, databases, IPs, brand trust, public perception, employees, Business secret and compliance status.

##  Threat

Anything that can cause damage to an asset.  
Examples: Hackers, malware, ransomware, nation-state actors, zero-days, fires and  floods.

> Threats exploit vulnerabilities in OS and code.

##  Vulnerability

A weakness that allows a threat to succeed.

Examples:
- Unpatched systems, weak passwords, no MFA  
- Heavy-theory environments (docs but no protection)  
- Security theatre (compliance over real security)  
- Politics over protection  
- Delay to patch/modernise  
- Lack of leadership support  

##  Risk

The potential loss (financial or otherwise) if a threat exploits a vulnerability and impacts an asset.  or In simple terms 
- **Risk** – is how much a business could lose if a threat takes advantage of a vulnerability — like a burglar walking through an unlocked door. In cybersecurity, this could be weak access controls or an unpatched system.



##  Risk Formula

**Risk = Threat × Vulnerability × Impact**  
High Risk = Real Threat + Weak Defenses + Valuable Asset  
Lowering any one factor reduces risk.

---

## Infrastructure & Data Security

- Infrastructure as Code (Terraform), CI/CD pipeline automation  
- Automated configuration deployment (Ansible)  
- TLS for secure comms  
- 802.1X for port-based auth  
- GDPR, NIST, Data Protection Best Practices  
- Data classification, minimisation, anonymisation  
- Incident response & breach notification  
- Employee security awareness  

> I strive to learn what I do not know and practice what I know — continuously evolving as a security technologist and network professional.

## Looking Ahead: 2025 and Beyond
As technology and threats evolve, so does my focus. In the years ahead, my work will center around building secure, scalable, and intelligent systems — with a deep emphasis on both **defensive and offensive capabilities**, often validated through hands-on **home lab environments**.
**Focus Areas:**

- Cloud Security (GCP-specialised).  
- Encryption & IAM (policy-driven and automated).  
- Terraform-first infrastructure with guardrails.  
- SOAR/XDR Engineering for automated threat response.  
- Governance & Compliance (ISO 27001, NIST, GDPR, NCSC).
- Home Lab Testing** – a safe space to break and build without risk — staying ahead of threats and out of real-world danger.

what about BBC.

 tshark -i 6 -Y "dns.qry.name contains bbc.co.uk"
Capturing on 'WiFi'

The DNS server replies with a DNS response:
We see  several IP addresses for bbc.co.uk (there are multiple IPs for load balancing right as shown below

- 151.101.128.81

But no actual data was transferred yet, as indicated by **Len=0** in all packets shown.
