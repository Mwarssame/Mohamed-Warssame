## Introduction

Since 2001, I have been working in front of the same screen — but the light changes every six months. Technology evolves rapidly, and so do I. Staying current and adapting has always been my mission, and now I am excited to share that knowledge with you through expert teaching and training.

# The Pentesting Lesson

I saw a pentester relying on a tool and reporting that a server in a /25 subnet was offline. In reality, the server was live and reachable on the network — the tool just couldn’t see it. My heart nearly boiled — it felt like I’d taken the wrong medicine!

I calmly said:  
**“You’re not on the same subnet as the server. The server isn’t offline — you’re simply on a different network.”**  
**Lesson:** Being inside a tool ≠ being on the network.  
Dude, you’re inside the tool — but not inside the network! 🤦‍♂️😂  
Sometimes tools lie, but the network doesn’t! 😅🔌  
**Know your routing. Know your scope. Tools don’t replace understanding.**

## 🔐 Security on Paper - Domain 1 (CISSP)

## ✅ Asset

Anything valuable to the business that must be protected.  
Examples: Servers, laptops, databases, IPs, brand trust, public perception, employees, Business secret and compliance status.

## ⚠️ Threat

Anything that can cause damage to an asset.  
Examples: Hackers, malware, ransomware, nation-state actors, zero-days, fires, floods.

> Threats exploit vulnerabilities in OS and code.

## 🧩 Vulnerability

A weakness that allows a threat to succeed.

Examples:
- Unpatched systems, weak passwords, no MFA  
- Heavy-theory environments (docs but no protection)  
- Security theatre (compliance over real security)  
- Politics over protection  
- Delay to patch/modernise  
- Lack of leadership support  

## 💰 Risk

The potential loss (financial or otherwise) if a threat exploits a vulnerability and impacts an asset.

## 💰 Risk Formula

**Risk = Threat × Vulnerability × Impact**  
High Risk = Real Threat + Weak Defenses + Valuable Asset  
Lowering any one factor reduces risk.

 🛠️ Skills & Mindset:
 
Cybersecurity Fundamentals, Monitoring & Tooling (e.g., SolarWinds). Defensive Security & Cloud-First Security Architectures.

🔐 Security on Paper  - Domain 1: Security and Risk Management ( CISSP) -Asset, Threat and Risk

✅ Asset

Anything valuable to the business that must be protected.
Examples: servers, Laptops, databases, intellectual property, Brand Trust,brand reputation, Puplic perception,  employees and compliance statusand  so on.

⚠️ Threat

Anything that can cause damage to an asset.
Examples: hackers, malware, ransomware, malicious actors, Rogue nation-states-  governments engaging in cyber espionage or warfare  and general Cybercriminals.
Zero-day exploits and Environmental / Non-Human Threats such as Fire and Floods.  
Threat can exploit sleeping Vulnerability in OS and Codes.

🧩 Vulnerability

A weakness that allows a threat to succeed.
Examples: unpatched systems, weak passwords, lack of MFA and poor security practices such as
-  Heavy-theory  environments – lots of documentation, but no real protection
- Security theater – compliance over actual security
- Politics over protection – decisions made to avoid blame or look good on paper, not to reduce risk
- Resistance to change – delay to upgrade, patch, or modernise systems and often wait weeks for approval
- Lack of leadership support – security seen as a cost, not a strategic priority

💰 Risk
- The potential loss (financial or otherwise) if a threat exploits a vulnerability and impacts an asset.

💰 Risk Formula

Risk = Threat × Vulnerability × Impact
High risk = real threat + weak defenses + valuable asset
Reducing any one factor lowers overall risk.

So If there is  no threat, no vulnerability, or no impact, the risk is low or zero. If all three are high, the risk is critical.


Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with Terraform, and CI/CD pipelines automation.

🛡️ Vulnerability Management Framework

Integrated forensics into a structured vulnerability management workflow:

Asset Discovery –  we started  with Inventory  hardware, software, and ended with  network assets listing.

Vulnerability Scanning –  we Identified and classified  vulnerabilities into categories.

Vulnerability Analysis & Ranking – We Prioritised based on severity and business impact.

Remediation Planning – Applied patches and recommended  mitigations.

Patch Testing & Deployment – Verified and  patched instances in pre-production environment and  applied stable versions to productions

Verification & Monitoring – Continuous scanning and tracking over time.

🔐 Aligned with information security principles:

Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability

Non-repudiation: Ensuring origin and integrity of forensic data


 🔍 Memory Forensics Highlights

I Used and documented key tools for memory analysis and live acquisition:
Examples:

- **Volatility** – Extract processes, DLLs, drivers, registry, and network data from memory dumps.
- **Rekall** – Fast, plugin-based memory analysis; useful for timeline generation and malware hunting.
- **FTK Imager** – GUI-based imaging tool that captures live RAM.
- **LiME** – Linux kernel module for acquiring physical RAM dumps.
- **Redline (FireEye)** – GUI-based forensics tool for IOC scanning and malware detection.
